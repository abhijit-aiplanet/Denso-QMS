                    DENSO QMS DEMO VIDEO NARRATION SCRIPT
        AI-Powered Quality Management System for Root Cause Analysis

Total Duration: ~4-5 minutes
Audience: Business stakeholders, Quality managers, Manufacturing leadership
Tone: Professional, concise, business-focused

================================================================================
SCREEN 1: WELCOME SCREEN / LANDING PAGE
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"Welcome to the Denso Quality Management System - an AI-powered platform that 
reduces root cause analysis time from weeks to days.

Traditionally, quality investigations take 4-8 weeks of manual work - tracing 
product lineage, reviewing records, analyzing changes, and correlating data. 
Our AI system does this in minutes using 8 specialized agents working in parallel.

Let me show you how it works by starting a new analysis."


================================================================================
SCREEN 2: COMPLAINT INTAKE FORM
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"First, we capture the complaint details. This form has product information, 
serial number, defect type, and description. In this case, it's a helium leak 
failure affecting multiple units from the same lot - a high-severity issue.

When I click 'Start Analysis', eight AI agents immediately activate and work 
in parallel - handling traceability, change detection, correlation analysis, 
hypothesis generation, and action planning. Let's watch them in action."


================================================================================
SCREEN 3: AGENT ACTIVITY MONITOR
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"Here you see all eight AI agents working simultaneously. The Traceability Agent 
traces production lineage. The Change Scan Agent identifies all process changes 
around the defect window using the 5M1E framework - Man, Machine, Material, 
Method, Measurement, Environment. The Correlation Engine performs statistical 
analysis to rank which changes most likely caused the defect. And the Hypothesis 
Generator creates root cause theories based on historical data.

This parallel processing is key - what normally takes weeks sequentially happens 
in minutes. The agents use AI models fine-tuned on manufacturing data combined 
with traditional statistical methods. Let's see the results."


================================================================================
SCREEN 4: TRACEABILITY DASHBOARD
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"The Traceability Dashboard shows the complete manufacturing journey - production 
line, machine, operator, and all child parts with supplier information. 

The trend chart reveals leak rates spiked starting January 10th. The AI insight 
says this pattern suggests a process-related cause, not random defects. This 
tells us something changed in our process. Let's find out what."


================================================================================
SCREEN 5: 5M1E CHANGE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"The 5M1E Change Analysis identifies every process change during the defect 
window across six categories: Man, Machine, Material, Method, Measurement, 
and Environment.

The system found three key changes: Flux weight reduced from 5.2g to 4.8g on 
January 8th - 89% correlation with defects. New flux supplier material - 76% 
correlation. And pressure gauge calibration drift - 82% correlation.

The correlation chart ranks these statistically. The flux weight reduction has 
the strongest correlation at 0.89 with p-value under 0.05 - meaning it's 
statistically significant, not random. Instead of manually reviewing dozens of 
changes, the AI has ranked them by likelihood. Now let's see the hypotheses."


================================================================================
SCREEN 6: HYPOTHESIS GENERATION VIEW
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"Based on the data, the system generates three root cause hypotheses ranked by 
confidence.

Primary cause at 89% confidence: Reduced flux weight causing insufficient 
coverage, creating micro-gaps and leak paths. Two contributing factors: the new 
flux supplier material at 76% confidence, and pressure gauge calibration drift 
at 68% confidence.

The ML models are trained on years of quality data and past incidents, so they 
recognize these patterns. Engineers now have a clear path forward instead of 
weeks of trial and error. Let's see the recommended actions."


================================================================================
SCREEN 7: ACTION PLAN / COUNTERMEASURES
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"The system recommends four specific countermeasures: Restore flux weight to 
5.2g with trial validation. Analyze the new flux supplier material. Recalibrate 
the pressure gauge with weekly verification. And strengthen the change management 
process to prevent future issues.

Each has priority, timeline, responsible team, and verification method. This 
isn't just firefighting - it's addressing the immediate issue plus systemic 
improvements. Now, how do we verify these worked? That's where KPI tracking comes 
in - and this timing is critical to understand."


================================================================================
SCREEN 8: KPI PERFORMANCE TRACKING
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"This KPI dashboard is crucial, but let's be clear on timing - these results 
are NOT instant. After implementing countermeasures, we must monitor production 
for 3-4 days minimum to confirm improvements are real, not random fluctuations.

The process: Day 1 - implement countermeasures. Days 2-5 - collect production 
data. Days 5-7 - analyze KPI trends. Then we can confirm sustained improvement.

We track four KPIs: Helium Leak Rate reduced 61.7% from 3.2% to 1.8%. First 
Pass Yield improved 3.8% to 97.8%. Mean Time To Repair down 33.5% to 12.3 minutes. 
And Defect Rate reduced 61.7% to 1800 PPM.

The system automates data collection and analysis. What took 4-8 weeks now 
takes 2-3 weeks total - minutes for analysis, plus time for countermeasure 
implementation and multi-day KPI verification."


================================================================================
SCREEN 9: ANALYSIS COMPLETE
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"The Analysis Complete screen summarizes everything: 85% confidence in root 
cause identification, 61.7% projected defect reduction, and 4 countermeasures 
planned.

Key findings in plain language: Primary cause is flux weight reduction, with 
contributing factors from new supplier material and gauge calibration.

You can export a comprehensive PDF report for customers or compliance, or start 
a new analysis. Every case is stored, building a knowledge base that makes the 
AI smarter over time."


================================================================================
SCREEN 10: CLOSING REMARKS & VALUE PROPOSITION
================================================================================

[NARRATION]

"To summarize the key benefits: Speed - 4-8 weeks reduced to 2-3 weeks total. 
Accuracy - AI analyzes thousands of data points with statistical confidence. 
Consistency - same rigorous 5M1E methodology every time. Scalability - one 
engineer can handle multiple investigations. And continuous learning - the 
system gets smarter with each case.

The ROI is clear: faster resolution, less downtime, fewer defective products, 
reduced warranty costs, and improved customer confidence.

The system integrates with your existing infrastructure - MES, quality databases, 
change management - making them smarter without replacement.

In industries where quality is paramount, this AI-powered system provides a 
significant competitive advantage. Thank you for watching."
