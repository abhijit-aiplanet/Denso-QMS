## 📊 Data Model Demonstration

The PoC includes realistic sample data:

### Complaint Example
- **Product**: SFA2 HVAC Unit
- **Defect**: Helium Leak
- **Part Number**: CHE-MIDDLE-5042
- **Date**: June 15, 2024

### Root Cause Journey
1. **Traceability**: Links to Lot-247, Machine M-3042, Operator OP-127
2. **5M1E Changes**: Identifies 5 process changes (Jun 10-14)
3. **Correlation**: Flux weight reduction shows 0.87 correlation with defects
4. **Hypothesis**: AI determines flux reduction (85% confidence) as primary cause
5. **Actions**: 4 countermeasures proposed (restore flux weight, material testing, etc.)
6. **Results**: 61.7% defect reduction, FPY improved by 3.8%
